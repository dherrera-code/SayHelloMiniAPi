Say Hello Endpoint: Mini Challenge #2

In this assignment, I created a controller that contains an endpoint to allow a user to pass in a name and be greeted back to the user!

Peer Review (Carlos Lopez):You have no name validation so if the user inputs nothing it'll still run but now display a hello other than that it works.
